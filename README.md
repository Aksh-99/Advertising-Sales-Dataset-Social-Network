# Sales Prediction Model and Tableau Dashboard

## Overview
This project aims to create a predictive model for sales using advertising data on various social networks and media channels. The dataset contains information on the number of ads on different platforms and the resulting sales. We'll also build a Tableau dashboard to visualize the dataset and the model's results.

## Data
The dataset contains 7698 rows and 12 columns with no missing values. The columns include:

- Instagram
- Facebook
- YouTube
- Twitter
- Telegram
- WhatsApp
- TikTok
- Radio
- TV
- Newspaper
- Website
- Sales (target variable)

## Predictive Model
We used a Random Forest Regression model to predict sales based on the number of ads on different platforms. The model was evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2. We also analyzed the residuals to ensure no patterns or trends might indicate issues with the model.

### Feature Importance
We analyzed the importance of each feature in predicting sales. "Total Ads" and "Average Ads" were found to be the most important features, followed by "Instagram" and "Facebook".

### Model Evaluation
The final Random Forest model with optimal hyperparameters achieved an R2 score of 0.985 on the test data, indicating that the model is highly accurate and reliable for predicting sales.

## Tableau Dashboard
For the Tableau dashboard, we have created visualizations to interpret the results generated by the model and analyze the dataset itself. Here are some key insights from the dashboard:

1. **Descriptive Analysis of the Dataset:**
   - Bar Charts or Pie Charts for Each Social Network and Media Channel to show the total number of ads for each channel.
   - Histogram or Box Plot of Sales to show the distribution of sales.

2. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation:**
   - Line Chart or Scatter Plot of Actual vs. Predicted Sales to show the relationship between actual and predicted sales.
   - Bar Chart of Feature Importance to show the importance of each feature in predicting sales.
   - Scatter Plot of Residuals vs. Predicted Values to show the residuals plotted against the predicted values.

3. **Interactive Insights:**
   - Interactive Filters for Social Networks and Media Channels to allow users to filter the data by social network or media channel and see the impact on sales.
   - Interactive Sliders for Feature Values to allow users to adjust the values of different features and see the impact on predicted sales.

We hope these visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset and help interpret the results generated by the model, making it easier for users to gain insights and make informed decisions.
